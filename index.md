# OS242

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub page for Operating Systems 2024 where I post my links and logs for this class. The *Links* page is filled with informative links about the specified week’s materials that I watched. Some of them boosted my quiz scores! The *LOG* page specifies the time I allocated for studying operating systems, attending classes, doing quizzes and assignments, and much more. Enjoy my page! :D
