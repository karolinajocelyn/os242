## W00: Overview 1, Virtualization & Scripting 
1. [Virtualization Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZR0rG3HKIk&t=204s): This is the first video that I watched from another Operating Systems GitHub page. This is so helpful for me to understand the basics of virtualization as someone who doesn't have a single clue about anything regarding this topic and operating systems in general.
2. [What is a Hypervisor?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAEbB2a50M): This is a follow up video from the first one, explained by amazing people from IBM Technology.
3. [Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-Wu178sOEE): While I was practicing OS MidTerm questions from the OS website, I stumbled upon questions regarding monolithic and micro kernels. As I was very stumped, I searched youtube and found this amazing video. Go check it out!
4. [Recording Week00: Overview 1, Virtualization & Scripting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fa9B-HZFtY): If you ever miss something in class, this video is here to help you. Explained by Mr. Anwar Ma'sum, this really helped me catch up with the materials that I missed in class.
5. [Linux Command Lines for Beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview): The beginner's guide to linux commands! Perfect for someone who never explored operating systems and linux. 

## W01: Overview 2, Virtualization & Scripting
1. [Recording Week01: Overview 2, Virtualization & Scripting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFjdbPBNbto): Another great lecture from Mr. Anwar Mas'um! In this video, he demo'ed bash command lines and also explained regex in depth! Really grateful to him as my quiz scores improved in week 01.
2. [Regular Expressions (RegEx) in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQxhojSdZM): Lazy to study? This 2 minutes video will definitely help you study as it did to me. Perfect for someone who doesn't understand RegEx with a short attention span.
3. [Shell Scripting for Beginners â€“ How to Write Bash Scripts in Linux](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/shell-scripting-crash-course-how-to-write-bash-scripts-in-linux/): For first time scripters! This website is very comprehensive and easy to follow for beginners. I learnt a lot from here.
4. [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/abs-guide.pdf): A complete guide for scripting after understanding the basics from link number 3.

## W02: Security, Protection, Privacy, & C-language
1. [Recording Week02: Protection and Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpmAKN9j2ks): Quick lecture on Protection and Security. The lecturer explained the concepts in a way that is very easy to understand for me.
2. [Recording Week02: C Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_o4mjBVbio&t=4595s): As someone who has coded with C before, I was still surprised with some things he showed here. This video unpacks lots of things, including data types, pointers, PID, and much more!
3. [C Programming Language - Intro to Computer Science - Harvard's CS50 (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix5jPkxsr7M): This video was my first introduction to programming. Yes, my first programming language was C, but I soon dropped it and moved to C++. David J Malan is an amazing lecturer. He explained numerous concepts in great detail here, but in a way that is easy to digest. It may be a little too easy for coders that are more familiar with computational thinking from using other languages such as Python and Java, but I would still **very much** recommend this to anyone.
4. [Difference Between Security and Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-security-and-protection/): Before reading this, I seriously thought these two methods are the same thing...
5. [Security Attacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIm0Ol9Dg4Y): A short but complete video on active and passive security attacks, and types of active security attacks, such as Masquerade, Replay, DDOS, and others!

3. [File System vs. Partition Table](https://www.pitsdatarecovery.co.uk/blog/file-system-vs-partition-table/): The article provides a clear and concise explanation of the difference between a partition table and a file system. It's a great resource for understanding how storage devices are organized.
4. [File & File Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM): I really recommend this video as the person explains it in such an easy and interesting way. Go give it a watch!
